First, you'll need to install package.json by typing "npm init -y" into the terminal. Then, install the node modules by typing "npm i" into the terminal. After that, we'll want to install the express dependency so type "npm i express" into the terminal. Finally, to install the UUID dependency type "npm i uuid" into the terminal.
